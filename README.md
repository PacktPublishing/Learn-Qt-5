# Learn QT 5
This is the code repository for [Learn QT 5](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learn-qt-5?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788478854), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Qt is a mature and powerful framework that delivers sophisticated applications across a multitude of platforms. It is widely used in embedded devices including TVs, satellite set-top boxes, medical equipment, car dashboards, and much more.

This book demonstrates the power and flexibility of the Qt framework and shows you how to write your application once and deploy it to multiple operating system desktops. You’ll build a complete real-world line of business (LOB) solution from scratch, with distinct library, user interface, and unit test projects.

We’ll build a modern, responsive user interface with QML and wire it up to rich C++ classes. You’ll also control every aspect of our project configuration and output with QMake, including platform detection and conditional expressions.

Moving on, you’ll build self-aware data entities that can serialise themselves to and from JSON. You’ll persist those data entities in a database and learn how to find and update them. We’ll reach out to the internet and consume a RSS feed. Finally, we’ll produce an installation package so that we can deploy our application to other machines.

This suite of essential techniques covers the core requirements for most LOB applications and will empower you to progress from blank page to shipped application.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/views">
        <file alias="MasterView">views/MasterView.qml</file>
    </qresource>
    <qresource prefix="/">
        <file>views/SplashView.qml</file>
        <file>views/DashboardView.qml</file>
        <file>views/CreateClientView.qml</file>
        <file>views/EditClientView.qml</file>
        <file>views/FindClientView.qml</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>
```

The reader should be comfortable with C++, but no prior knowledge of Qt or QML is required. On Mac OS X, you will need to install XCode and have launched it at least once. On Windows, you may optionally install Visual Studio in order to have the MSVC compiler available.
